# ReverseShell
A simple reverse shell implementation in PowerShell for Windows, as well as a python script to send commands to and receive outputs from the target machine

Uses socket

Usage:

1. initiate python script to listen to connections
2. upload and run PowerShell script onto a windows machine that has previously been penetrated

Now you have remote command line acces to the targeted machine, with the same privileges the PowerShell script was run
